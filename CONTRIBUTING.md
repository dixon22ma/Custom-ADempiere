## How can I help?

## Adempiere is not perfect but there are many ways to help:

   - Give feedback
   - Report bugs
   - Add or update translations
   - Improve the documentation
   - Writing code
   - Tell your friends that Custom-Adempiere is awesome :)

Before doing any large undertaking, open a new issue and explain your proposal.

## I want to give feedback

   - You think something should be improved (user interface, feature requests)
   - Check if your idea is not already proposed
   - Open a new issue
   - Describe your idea
   - You can also up-vote with +1 on existing proposals
   
## I want to report a bug

   - Check if the issue is not already reported
   - Open a new ticket
   - Explain what is broken
   - Describe how to reproduce the bug
   - Describe your environment (Adempiere version, OS, Java version, database version)
